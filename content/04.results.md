### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### Global Comparison of bioRxiv and PubMed Central 

![
BioRxiv has more category specific terms whereas PubMed Central has more patient oriented articles.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to bioRxiv.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with bioRxiv whereas values less than one indicate high association with PubMed Central.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a barchart of token frequency appearing in bioRxiv and PMC respectively.

The linguistic style of preprints changes as preprints navigate the peer review process. 
We quantified this change on a global scale by calculating the odds ratio of the frequency of tokens appearing in bioRxiv over the tokens appearing in PubMed Central (PMC).
The tokens with a high odds ratio are topic-specific words such as: "neuron", "genome", "RNA" and "network" (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}A).
These tokens appear in greater proportions in bioRxiv relative to PMC (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}B).
Furthermore, references and citation tokens ("et", "al", "fig" appear with an odds greater than one (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}A).
Majority of tokens with a low odds ratio are centered around medical research.
These tokens consist of words such as: "patient", "health", "study" and measurement symbols such as: $\plusminus$, "ml" and "p" (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}A).
Furthermore, these terms appear in great proprotions within PMC compared to biorxiv (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}B).

#### Published Preprint Differences
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between Preprint and Published documents (based on odds ratio)

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of Principal Components
1. Provide an example of the word cloud for principal components
2. Show plot of the principal components and the scatterplot
3. Mention that the word clouds can be found at xyz

### Journal Recommendations/Audience Associations
1. Title will change once analysis is finished 
2. Provide key figure for this section and take-home message
