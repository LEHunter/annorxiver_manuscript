### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### bioRxiv Repository

![
Neuroscience and bioinformatics are the two most common topics for preprints on bioRxiv.
This bar chart depicts the number of preprints that fall into each author-selected topic area.

![
Most of bioRxiv's preprints report new research findings.

This bar chart depicts the number of articles categorized based on author-selected article types.

Each preprint on bioRxiv has an author-selected topic area, and the predominant area in past reports has been neuroscience [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133].
Our analysis of the full text release of bioRxiv confirms this previous finding (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
The author-selected topic area abundances that we found in the full text largely matched previous studies [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133; @doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].
One exception was microbiology, which has a larger share of preprints than in a previous report from 2018 [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133] (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Authors also select from three article types when they upload their preprints.
We found that most preprints are categorized as new results (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_headings}), which is consistent with previous findings [@doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].

#### Global View
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between bioRxiv and PubMed Central (based on odds ratio)

#### Published Preprint Differences
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between Preprint and Published documents (based on odds ratio)

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of Principal Components
1. Provide an example of the word cloud for principal components
2. Show plot of the principal components and the scatterplot
3. Mention that the word clouds can be found at xyz

### Journal Recommendations/Audience Associations
1. Title will change once analysis is finished 
2. Provide key figure for this section and take-home message
