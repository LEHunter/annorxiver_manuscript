## Results

### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### Global View
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between bioRxiv and PubMed Central (based on odds ratio)

#### Published Preprint Differences
![
Top scoring tokens for preprints are focused on figure citations whereas their published versions are more focused on data availability.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to preprints.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with preprints while values less than one indicate a high association with published articles.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a barchart of token frequency appearing in preprints and published versions of preprints respectively.

Preprints change as they undergo the revision process prior to being published.
We sought to quantify the linguistic difference between preprints and their published versions.
We noticed that top scoring tokens with respect to preprints are mainly associated with citations and general category terms (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}A).
Likewise the top scoring tokens in respect to the published version of preprints are centered on data availability and measurement statistics (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}A). 

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of Principal Components
1. Provide an example of the word cloud for principal components
2. Show plot of the principal components and the scatterplot
3. Mention that the word clouds can be found at xyz

### Journal Recommendations/Audience Associations
1. Title will change once analysis is finished 
2. Provide key figure for this section and take-home message
