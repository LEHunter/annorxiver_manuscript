![
Neuroscience and bioinformatics are the two most common topics for preprints on bioRxiv.
This bar chart depicts the number of preprints that fall into each category of bioRxiv.

BioRxiv has been notorious for having a bountiful supply of neuroscience preprints [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133].
Our findings support this trend when we quantified the number of preprints per article category within bioRxiv (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Furthermore, majority of our category rankings match with previous studies [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133; @doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].
The exception being microbiology as more papers were submitted than projected in 2018 [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133] (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Lastly, we quantified the type of result reported in each preprint.
We found that the majority of preprints mention new results (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_headings}), which is consisted with previous findings [@doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].

#### Global View
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between bioRxiv and PubMed Central (based on odds ratio)

#### Published Preprint Differences
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between Preprint and Published documents (based on odds ratio)

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of Principal Components
1. Provide an example of the word cloud for principal components
2. Show plot of the principal components and the scatterplot
3. Mention that the word clouds can be found at xyz

### Journal Recommendations/Audience Associations
1. Title will change once analysis is finished 
2. Provide key figure for this section and take-home message
