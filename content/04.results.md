### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### bioRxiv Repository

![
Neuroscience, bioinformatics and microbiology are the most common fields for preprints on bioRxiv.
This bar chart depicts the number of preprints that fall into each category of bioRxiv.

![
Most bioRxiv's preprints report new research findings.
This bar char depicts the number of articles categorized based on report findings.

Users who submit preprints select topic areas and specify the type of finding.
Majority of research findings report new results (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_headings}).
Regarding topic categories, majority of preprints fall within the neuroscience field (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Likewise, clinical trials, palentology, and scientific communication and education topics fall into the bottom three categories (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).

#### Global View
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between bioRxiv and PubMed Central (based on odds ratio)

#### Published Preprint Differences
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between Preprint and Published documents (based on odds ratio)

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of Principal Components
1. Provide an example of the word cloud for principal components
2. Show plot of the principal components and the scatterplot
3. Mention that the word clouds can be found at xyz

### Journal Recommendations/Audience Associations
1. Title will change once analysis is finished 
2. Provide key figure for this section and take-home message
