### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### bioRxiv Repository
Overall, majority of preprints are writing to present new research results.
![
BioRxiv has an influx of neuroscience preprints followed by bioinformatics and then microbiology.
This bar chart depicts the number of preprints that fall into each category of bioRxiv.

#### PubMed Central Open Access Subset

![
Majority of PubMed Central's (PMC) articles are research articles.
This bar chart depicts the number of articles that fall into each article category.

#### Global View
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between bioRxiv and PubMed Central (based on odds ratio)

#### Published Preprint Differences
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between Preprint and Published documents (based on odds ratio)

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of Principal Components
1. Provide an example of the word cloud for principal components
2. Show plot of the principal components and the scatterplot
3. Mention that the word clouds can be found at xyz

### Journal Recommendations/Audience Associations
1. Title will change once analysis is finished 
2. Provide key figure for this section and take-home message
