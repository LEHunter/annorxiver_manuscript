### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### Global Comparison of bioRxiv and PubMed Central 

![
BioRxiv has more category specific terms whereas PubMed Central has more patient oriented articles.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to bioRxiv.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with bioRxiv whereas values less than one indicate high association with PubMed Central.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a barchart of token frequency appearing in bioRxiv and PMC respectively.

The linguistic style of the bioRxiv corpus differs from the PMC corpus.
We compared preprints in bioRxiv and published manuscripts in PMC.
We found that tokens such as (PUT TOKENS HERE) had a high odds ratio, indicating enrichment in (PMC or bioRXiv?) (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
Tokens with a high odds ratio are topic-specific words such as: "neuron", "genome", "RNA" and "network" (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
Furthermore, references and citation tokens ("et", "al", "fig" appear with an odds greater than one (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
Majority of tokens with a low odds ratio are centered around medical research.
These tokens consist of words such as: "patient", "health", "study" and measurement symbols such as: $\plusminus$, "ml" and "p" (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).

#### Published Preprint Differences
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between Preprint and Published documents (based on odds ratio)

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of Principal Components
1. Provide an example of the word cloud for principal components
2. Show plot of the principal components and the scatterplot
3. Mention that the word clouds can be found at xyz

### Journal Recommendations/Audience Associations
1. Title will change once analysis is finished 
2. Provide key figure for this section and take-home message
