## Methods

### Datasets

#### BioRxiv
BioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] is a repository of biological and biomedical research preprints.
We downloaded an xml snapshot of this repository on February 3, 2020 from   bioRxiv's Amazon S3 resource [@https://www.biorxiv.org/tdm] that contained the full text and image content of 98,023 preprints.
Preprints on bioRxiv are versioned, and 26,905 of 98,023 contained more than one version.
When preprints had multiple versions, we used only the latest one. 
Preprints in this snapshot were grouped into one of twenty-nine different categories.
Each preprint was also classified as a new result, confirmatory finding, or contradictory finding.
Some preprints in this snapshot have been withdrawn from bioRxiv.
When a preprint is withdrawn, its content is replaced with the reason for withdrawal.
Because we use only the latest version, withdrawn preprints only contain withdrawn statements within their content.

#### PubMed Central
PubMed Central (PMC) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] is a repository that contains free-to-read articles.
PMC contains two types of contributions: closed access articles from research funded by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and articles published under Gold Open Access [@doi:10.1007/s12471-017-1064-2] publishing schemes.
Paper availability within PMC is largely dependent on the journal's participation level [@https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/submission-methods/].
Individual journals have can fall into the following categories: fully participation in submitting articles to PMC, selective participation as a select few of papers are submitted to PMC, only submit papers according to NIH's public access policy [@https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_8/8.2.2_nih_public_access_policy.htm], and lastly no participation at all.
As of September 2019, PMC has a total of 5,725,819 articles available [@https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/intro/].
Out of these 5 million articles about 3 million are considered open access and available for text processing systems [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz070;@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz389].
We downloaded a snapshot of this open access subset on January 31, 2020.
This snapshot contains papers such as literature reviews, book reviews, editorials, case reports, research articles and more; however, we subsampled it to focus solely on research articles.
