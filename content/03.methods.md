## Methods

### Datasets

#### BioRxiv
BioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] is a repository of biological and biomedical research preprints.
We downloaded an xml snapshot of this repository on February 3, 2020 from   bioRxiv's Amazon S3 resource [@https://www.biorxiv.org/tdm] that contained the full text and image content of 98,023 preprints.
Preprints on bioRxiv are versioned, and in our snapshot 26,905 of 98,023 contained more than one version.
When preprints had multiple versions, we used only the latest one. 
Preprints in this snapshot were grouped into one of twenty-nine different categories.
Each preprint was also classified as a new result, confirmatory finding, or contradictory finding.
Some preprints in this snapshot have been withdrawn from bioRxiv.
When a preprint is withdrawn, its content is replaced with the reason for withdrawal.
Because we used the latest version, withdrawn preprints in our analysis contained only statements indicating their removal.

#### PubMed Central
PubMed Central (PMC) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] is a repository that contains free-to-read articles.
PMC contains two types of contributions: closed access articles from research funded by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) appearing after an embargo period and articles published under Gold Open Access [@doi:10.1007/s12471-017-1064-2] publishing schemes.
Paper availability within PMC is largely dependent on the journal's participation level [@url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/submission-methods/].
Individual journals have can fully participate in submitting articles to PMC, selectively participate sending only a few few of papers to PMC, only submit papers according to NIH's public access policy [@url:https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_8/8.2.2_nih_public_access_policy.htm], or not participate at all.
As of September 2019, PMC had 5,725,819 articles available [@url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/intro/].
Out of these 5 million articles, about 3 million were open access and available for text processing systems [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz070;@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz389].
We downloaded a snapshot of this open access subset on January 31, 2020.
This snapshot contains papers such as literature reviews, book reviews, editorials, case reports, research articles and more; however, we used only the research articles.

### Comparing Corpora
We used gensim [@raw:rehurek_lrec] (version 3.8.1) to preprocess the bioRxiv and PubMed Central corpora.
We removed the 337 gensim-provided stopwords.
Throughout our analysis we encountered non-word symbols (e.g., $\pm$), so we refer to words and symbols as tokens to avoid confusion.

Following the cleaning process, we calculated the frequency of every token shared between both corpora.
Because many tokens were unique to one set or the other and observed at low frequency, we used the union of the top 100 most frequent tokens from each corpus to compare them.
We generated a contingency table and calculated the odds ratio for each token.
Furthermore, we also calculated the 95% confidence interval for each odds ratio [@https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431098/].

### Visualizing the Preprint Landscape

#### Generate Document Representation
We used gensim [@raw:rehurek_lrec] (version 3.8.1) to train a word2vec continuous bag of words (CBOW) [@arxiv:1301.3781] model over the bioRxiv corpus. 
Our neural network architecture had 300 hidden nodes, and we trained this model for 20 epochs.
We set a fixed random seed and otherwise used gensim's default settings.
Following training, we generated a document vector for every article within bioRxiv and PubMed Central.
This document vector is calculated by taking the average of every token present within a given article, ignoring those that were absent from the word2vec model.

#### Dimensionality Reduction of Document Embeddings
We used principal component analysis (PCA) [@doi:10.1111/1467-9868.00196] to project bioRxiv document vectors into a low dimensional space.
We trained this model using scikit-learn's [@raw:scikit-learn] implementation of a randomized solver [@arxiv:0909.4061] with a random seed of 100, output of 50 principal components, and default settings for all other parameters.
For each principal component we calculated its cosine similarity with  all tokens in our word2vec model's vocabulary.
We report the top 100 positive and negative scoring tokens in the form of  word clouds, where the size of each word corresponds to the magnitude of similarity and color represents positive (blue) or negative (orange) association.

### Journal Recommendation
We trained two k-nearest neighbor classifiers to recommend journals based on article content.
The first classifier recommends journals based on articles in close proximity to the query and the second classifier recommends journals based on close proximity to each journal's centroid.
We used PubMed Central's (PMC) open access dataset to train both models.
We preprocessed this dataset by reserving articles that were found in both PMC and bioRxiv for our test set and used the rest for training.
Furhermore, we filtered out journals that had less than 100 articles within PMC and downsampled the remaining journals to only have 100 articles as this prevents overrepresentation of mega journals.
We compared two distance metrics (Eucledian distance and Manhattan distance) for both classifiers.
We report our results in the form of accuracy; however, we considered a prediction to be positive if the correct journal appeared within the ten closest neighbors of a query.
The results of the first classifier were generated using 10-fold cross validation on the downsampled training set.
The second classifier calculated centroids using the full training set and then was optimized using the downsampled training set.
