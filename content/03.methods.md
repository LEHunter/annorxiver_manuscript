## Methods

### Datasets

#### BioRxiv
BioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] is a repository that contains biological and biomedical research preprints.
We downloaded an xml snapshot of this repository on February 3, 2020 and this snapshot contained 98,023 total preprints.
26,905 out of 98,023 are preprints that contain more than one version as bioRxiv allows users to upload revisions and corrections.
We focused on using the latest version of preprints for our analyses. 
Each preprint in bioRxiv can fall into one of the twenty-nine different categories with neuroscience being the most popular (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Furthermore, the content of each preprint amounts to one of the following: presenting a new result, confirming a previous finding or presenting a contradiction to a previous finding.
Some preprints within this snapshot have been withdrawn from bioRxiv.
Overall, majority of preprints within this dataset present new research results.

![
Biorxiv has an influx of neuroscience preprints followed by bioinformatics and then microbiology.
This barchart depicts the number of preprints that fall into each category of bioRxiv.

#### PubMed Central
Pubmed Central (PMC) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] is a repository that contains open access to published research articles.
We downloaded a snapshot of this repository on January 31, 2020.
This snapshot contains 9,440 unique journals with 2,719,226 different articles (Figure {@fig:pmc_statistics}).
We subsampled this snapshot to only use research articles, which leaves 1,977,651 unique articles for our analyses.

Majoirty of Pubmed Central's (PMC) articles are research articles.
