## Methods

### Datasets

#### BioRxiv
BioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] is a repository of biological and biomedical research preprints.
We downloaded an xml snapshot of this repository on February 3, 2020 from   bioRxiv's Amazon S3 resource [@https://www.biorxiv.org/tdm] that contained the full text and image content of 98,023 preprints.
Preprints on bioRxiv are versioned, and in our snapshot 26,905 of 98,023 contained more than one version.
When preprints had multiple versions, we used only the latest one. 
Preprints in this snapshot were grouped into one of twenty-nine different categories.
Each preprint was also classified as a new result, confirmatory finding, or contradictory finding.
Some preprints in this snapshot have been withdrawn from bioRxiv.
When a preprint is withdrawn, its content is replaced with the reason for withdrawal.
Because we used the latest version, withdrawn preprints in our analysis contained only statements indicating their removal.

#### PubMed Central
PubMed Central (PMC) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] is a repository that contains free-to-read articles.
PMC contains two types of contributions: closed access articles from research funded by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) appearing after an embargo period and articles published under Gold Open Access [@doi:10.1007/s12471-017-1064-2] publishing schemes.
Paper availability within PMC is largely dependent on the journal's participation level [@https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/submission-methods/].
Individual journals have can fully participate in submitting articles to PMC, selectively participate sending only a few few of papers to PMC, only submit papers according to NIH's public access policy [@https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_8/8.2.2_nih_public_access_policy.htm], or not participate at all.
As of September 2019, PMC had 5,725,819 articles available [@https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/intro/].
Out of these 5 million articles, about 3 million were open access and available for text processing systems [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz070;@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz389].
We downloaded a snapshot of this open access subset on January 31, 2020.
This snapshot contains papers such as literature reviews, book reviews, editorials, case reports, research articles and more; however, we used only the research articles.
