## Methods

### Datasets

#### BioRxiv
BioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] is a repository of biological and biomedical research preprints.

We downloaded an xml snapshot of this repository on February 3, 2020 from _WHERE_ that contained the full text and image content of 98,023 preprints.
Preprionts on bioRxiv are versioned, and 26,905 of 98,023 contained more than one version.
When preprints had multiple versions we used only the latest one. 
Preprints in this snapshot were grouped into one of twenty-nine different categories.
Each preprint was also classified as a new result, confirmatory finding, or contradictory finding.
Some preprints in this snapshot have been withdrawn from bioRxiv.
When a preprint is withdrawn, X happens.
Because we use only the latest version, (what happens to these preprints).
Overall, majority of preprints are writing to present new research results.

![
BioRxiv has an influx of neuroscience preprints followed by bioinformatics and then microbiology.
This bar chart depicts the number of preprints that fall into each category of bioRxiv.

#### PubMed Central
PubMed Central (PMC) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] is a repository that contains free-to-read articles.
PMC contains two types of contributions: closed access articles from research funded by the United States National Institutes of Health and articles published under Gold Open Access _REFERENCE FOR THIS_ publishing schemes.
HOW DO CLOSED ACCESS ARTICLES GET HERE AND HOW MANY ARE THERE.
HOW DO OPEN ACCESS ARTICLES GET HERE AND HOW MANY ARE THERE.
WHICH SET IS AVAILABLE FOR LITERATURE MINING?
We downloaded a snapshot of the open access subset on January 31, 2020.
This snapshot contains 2,719,226 different articles from 9,440 unique journals (Figure {@fig:pmc_statistics}).
We subsampled this snapshot to only use research articles, which leaves 1,977,651 unique articles for our analyses.

Majority of PubMed Central's (PMC) articles are research articles.
