## Methods

### Datasets

#### bioRxiv
BioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] is a repository that contains a listing of preprints for the biological domain.
An xml snapshot of this repository was downloaded on February 3, 2020.
This snapshot contained 98,023 total preprints with 71,118 total unique preprints as some preprints may contain multiple versions.
For this analysis we subsetted this dataset to only focus on the most latest version of preprints.
Each preprint can fall into one of the twenty-nine different categories with neuroscience being the most popular (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Furthermore, each preprint can consist of being a new result, confirmatory result or a contradictory result (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_preprint_headings}).

![
Biorxiv has an influx of neuroscience preprints followed by bioinformatics and then microbiology.
This barchart depicts the number of preprints that fall into each category of bioRxiv.

Majority of bioRxiv's preprints are new results, but some can consist of confirmatory or contradictory results.
This barchart depicts the number of preprints that contain the type of result: new result, confirmatory result, contradictory result and even withdrawn results.

#### PubMed Central
Pubmed Central (PMC) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.98.2.381] is a repository that contains open access published articles.
We downloaded a snapshot of this repository on Janurary 31, 2020.
This snapshot contains 9440 unique journals with 2,719,226 different articles (Figure {@fig:pmc_statistics}).
For this analysis we subsetted this snapshot to focus on research articles only which leaves 1,977,651 unique articles. 

![
Majoirty of Pubmed Central's (PMC) articles are research articles.
